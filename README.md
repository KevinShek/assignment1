# Description of this Repo
This personal repository is aimmed for completing the assignments following Dave Churchill COMP4300 lessons: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_xRyXins84_Sq7yZkxGP_MgYAH-Zo8Uu
There will be a branch for each assignment as I am working it through, with main being assignment 1.
The main objective was to learn about game programming with C++.

## Assignment 1 Description
The way this differ from what Dave wanted, I have done it and split them apart into different files for different classes and struct. This is not the optimal method of doing things but a learning experience for working with C++ for myself. Thank you for having a look.
The objective of this assignment was to understand and use SFML and ImGui.
